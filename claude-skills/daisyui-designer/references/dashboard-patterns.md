# Dashboard Design Patterns for Enterprise Interfaces

## Component Design Patterns

**Data Information:**
- Individual values: specific data points in a data set
- Derived values: abstractions like KPIs calculated independently
- Filtered data: subsets based on defined rules
- Thresholds: judgments categorizing data as good/bad/neutral
- Aggregated data: consolidated values from multiple sources
- Detailed datasets: raw data with multiple elements and attributes

**Meta Information:**
- Data source identification with collection/analysis details
- Disclaimers explaining processing decisions and limitations
- Data descriptions clarifying what's being displayed
- Update timestamps indicating freshness
- Annotations highlighting specific changes or developments

**Visual Representations:**
- Numbers: prominently displayed key values with units
- Trend arrows: directional indicators showing change
- Pictograms: symbolic representations of concepts
- Gauges/progress bars: range-based value displays
- Signature charts: small trend visualizations without detailed axes
- Detailed charts: precise value readings with full labeling
- Tables: tabular raw data presentation
- Text lists: non-quantitative information streams

**Interactions:**
- Exploration: brushing, linking, detail-on-demand tooltips
- Navigation: tabs, links, buttons, animated transitions
- Personalization: adding/resizing/reordering elements
- Filter and focus: search fields, checkboxes, sliders, radio buttons

## Composition Design Patterns

**Screenspace Management:**
- Screenfit: all content visible without scrolling
- Overflow: content extends beyond visible boundaries
- Detail-on-demand: conditional information reveal
- Parameterized: user-controlled content filtering
- Multiple pages: distributed content across separate views

**Structure:**
- Single page layouts
- Hierarchical multi-page organizations enabling drill-down
- Parallel pages at equivalent informational levels
- Open structures with flexible relationships
- Semantic structures following organizational logic

**Page Layout:**
- Open layouts: varied widget sizes without rigid organization
- Table layouts: aligned rows/columns representing data facets
- Stratified layouts: top-down information hierarchy
- Grouped layouts: visibly associated widgets
- Schematic layouts: spatially-informed widget placement

**Color Strategies:**
- Distinct palettes differentiating widgets/data types
- Shared schemes maintaining brand consistency
- Data encoding using color for categories/scales
- Semantic schemes mapping data to meaningful associations
- Emotive palettes creating viewer response

## Applying These Patterns with DaisyUI

**Component Selection:**
- Use `<div class="stat">` for individual KPI displays
- Apply `<div class="card">` for widget containers
- Implement `<div class="table">` for detailed datasets
- Utilize `<progress>` and radial-progress for gauges

**Layout Implementation:**
- `<div class="stats">` for grouped stat displays
- Grid utilities (`grid grid-cols-3`) for table layouts
- `<div class="divider">` for visual separation
- `<div class="drawer">` for detail-on-demand sidebars

**Interaction Patterns:**
- `<div class="tabs">` for navigation
- `<div class="collapse">` for progressive disclosure
- `<div class="dropdown">` for filters
- `<div class="tooltip">` for contextual information
